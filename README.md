# Crowdfunding_ETL
The codes for this task are located in the repo Laos27/Crowdfunding_ETL, inside the folder "Starter_Files".

The Jupiter Notebook "ETL_Mini_Project_LOrtega.ipnyb" contains the creation of the Category, Subcategory, Capaign and Contacts Dataframes.

Data is loaded in pg4Admin using schema "crowdfunding_db_schema.sql", which can be found in the same folder "Starter_Files". An image of the output from pg4Admin was added into the Resources folder where can be confirmed the Tables creation and that the tables have the correct data.

This was a group project where we collaborated during classes. Project Group: Bec Butcher, Liam McCarthy, Ohana Bernardi and me (Luz Ortega).
